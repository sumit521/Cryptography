# Cryptography
Shell scripts to encrypt and decrypt your files and folders  using AES(advanced ecnryption standard ) algorithm. Script can implemented using Cygwin also.
If you have muptiple files and folders at different locations in your computer, you can easily encrypt/decrypt all of them in one go with a common passphrase using thses scripts.
Just mention the paths to directories where your files and folder (which are to be encrypted) are present in paths.txt. Save it. Run the scipt.
However, original files are not changed in encrption process. New encrypted files are generated.
